# About Oko
<br>

Powerful, flexible and effective while simple and easy. 

Better than the rest because it's smart. 

After using and analysing all existing solutions we've determined that none of them is really working.

How many times have you pressed 'skip', 'postpone', 'break later' buttons?

Now try Oko and enjoy the result of hundreds of hours of psychology studies and user experience analysis. 

Oko will signal you 5 minutes before the break with a bright full screen color. 
You'll get several alerts more before the break starts.

Features:
- smart non intrusive warnings before the break

- shows several images of eye exercises

- sound alert option to notify you with voice when the break starts and ends

- inactivity option. When enabled, your inactive minutes will not count as work

- progressive notifications: even if you had to postpone the break, you'll get a notification reminder 

- menu icon work time indicator. Quickly see how much is remaining until the break

- displays a full-screen window on main and second monitor


Definitely the only app you need with unique method.
