# Features

By pressing just one button, you will drink and eat on time, that is, you will be healthy.


Smart Meals is a tool for busy people to help you eat regularly. Today there are many people who do not have a fixed schedule. It happens that we are immersed in work so much that we forget to drink or eat on time.

Remember, drinking 30 ml of water per kg of body is the basis of the health of your body.

How does it work:
1. By pressing the kiwi button, the application saves current date and time and sets up several reminders after 4 hours. (4 hours interval can be changed in the settings).

2. You continue to do your work. An hour and a half passes and the application reminds you with a voice that you can already drink water.

3. When half an hour is left before the meal, the application will notify you again with a voice so that you can cook.

4. And finally, after 4 hours (or any other interval that you selected in settings), another notification will come saying that itâ€™s time to eat. The application will remind you of this every 10 minutes until you click on the kiwi button.


In addition to the kiwi button, there is a water button. We click on it every time we drink water entering the amount. The app will save the total amount for you to know. 

When you open Smart Meals, you can instantly find out the necessary information:

- the next time to eat
- how many hours and minutes remain
- how much water did you drink today
- time of the last time you ate (by clicking on it, it is possible to adjust the meal time)


It is important not to mix food and liquid. The secret is not to interfere with the stomach digestion. A liquid can be drunk at any time but not later than 30 minutes before meals. Or not earlier than an hour and a half after eating.


Using the program you can:
1. Establish a healthy metabolism in your body.
2. Eliminate dehydration of cells.
3. Normalize PH - a hydrogen indicator.
4. Lose weight or gain it depending on the interval of food intake you set.
5. Break away from work and drink and eat on time, observing regular cycles.


All people want to be healthy and this program will help, because the person himself is the main source of all health ills. Your health is really in your hands.
